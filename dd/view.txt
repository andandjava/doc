This class represents the basic building block for user interface components. 
A View occupies a rectangular area on the screen and is responsible for drawing and event handling. View is the base class for widgets, which are used to create interactive UI components (buttons, text fields, etc.). 
The ViewGroup subclass is the base class for layouts, which are invisible containers that hold other Views (or other ViewGroups) and define their layout properties.

A ViewGroup is a special view that can contain other views (called children.) 
The view group is the base class for layouts and views containers.
