Like a house having a venomous snake is not suitable for living. In the same manner a house having an ill-tempered wife with low morals, deceitful friends, and with impolite talkative servants is also not suitable for living.

Chanakya says that money is one of the most significant assets a man must have. It brings you the honour, supports you, and makes you capable to deal with calamities.

A man must not live in a place that has no fear of law, where people are shameless, where exists no clever man, people lack in spirit of charity, and where exists no art.


Test the wife at time when your wealth is lost, a friend when in need, relatives at the time of crises, and a servant on some important mission.


A person who cannot decide his goal, simply cannot win.
